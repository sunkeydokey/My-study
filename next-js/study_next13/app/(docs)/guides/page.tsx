        How to Use Next.js 13 App Directory Catch-All Routes
      </h1>
      <p className="text-lg">
        Next.js 13 introduced a new feature called "app directory catch-all
        routes" that allows you to create dynamic routes based on the file
        system in the `pages` directory. Here's how you can use it:
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">
        Step 1: Create the App Directory
      </h2>
      <p className="text-lg">
        In your Next.js project, create a new directory called `app` in the root
        directory. This is where you'll define your app-specific pages and
        catch-all routes.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">
        Step 2: Define the Catch-All Route
      </h2>
      <p className="text-lg">
        Inside the `app` directory, create a file named `[...slug].js` (or
        `[...slug].tsx` if you're using TypeScript). This file will act as the
        catch-all route and handle all dynamic routes under the `app` directory.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg">
        Here's an example of how you can define the catch-all route file:
      </p>

      <pre className="bg-gray-200 p-4 rounded-lg mt-4">
        <code className="text-sm font-mono text-gray-800">
          {`// pages/app/[...slug].js\n\n`}
          {`import React from "react";\n\n`}
          {`const AppPage = ({ query }) => {\n`}
          {`  // Access the dynamic route parameters from the query object\n`}
          {`  const { slug } = query;\n\n`}
          {`  return (\n`}
          {`    <div>\n`}
          {`      <h1>{slug.join("/")}</h1>\n`}
          {`      {/* Render your app-specific content here */}\n`}
          {`    </div>\n`}
          {`  );\n`}
          {`};\n\n`}
          {`export default AppPage;\n`}
        </code>
      </pre>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">
        Step 3: Accessing the Dynamic Route Parameters
      </h2>
      <p className="text-lg">
        Inside the catch-all route file, you can access the dynamic route
        parameters by destructuring the `query` object passed as a prop to the
        page component. In the example above, we're accessing the `slug`
        parameter, which will be an array of path segments. You can use it to
        render your app-specific content dynamically based on the route.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">
        Step 4: Add Content and Functionality
      </h2>
      <p className="text-lg">
        You can now add your app-specific content and functionality within the
        catch-all route component. This can include fetching data, rendering
        components, and handling user interactions.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Step 5: Test and Deploy</h2>
      <p className="text-lg">
        Once you've defined your catch-all route and added your app-specific
        content, you can test it locally by running your Next.js app. You can
        navigate to different dynamic routes under the `app` directory and see
        the content rendered dynamically.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg">
        When you're ready, you can deploy your Next.js app with the catch-all
        routes to a hosting provider of your choice. Make sure your hosting
        provider supports Next.js 13 or later.
      </p>

        .js 13 app directory catch-all routes. You can now create dynamic routes
        under the `app` directory and render app-specific content based on those
        routes.
